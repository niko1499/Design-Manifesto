# Design Manifesto

### About Me
Hello, I am Nikolas Gamarra. I am currently a Junior at Worcester Polytechnic Institute (WPI), where I am majoring in Robotic Engineering with minors Computer Science and Mechanical Engineering. At WPI the Robotic Engineering program is a combination of Mechanical Engineering, Electrical Engineering, and Computer Science.

I have a passion for a diversity of DIY projects including everything from woodworking and furniture building to designing and programming robots. A common theme for my projects is a focus on aesthetically pleasing objects with unique functionality. 

### Design Expierences

The design process for this class helped the final product of my projects be more refined and well thought out. This is because sticking to the design process early forces myself and my teams to iron out the pros and cons of various possible implementations early. One of the most useful modes of the design process was the “Wizard of Oz” Testing. These tests allowed for constructive feedback on the final product very early into the development cycle. Thus preventing many wasted hours if there was a major flaw with what we wanted to do that we caught early.  I would say that a limitation of strictly adhering to the design process is that it made people feel they needed to do superfluous actions or drawings to backward justify the obvious choice. 

The most challenging topic in the course was using Affecteva for the [Design for Wellbeing](https://medium.com/@ilanazeldin/design-for-wellbeing-7cc8d2f7a9a7) project. This project was a bit above my experience level in terms of programming for websites. However I feel I learned a lot by being exposed to this topic and feel much more comfortable around jQuery.


# My Five Design Principles

- See past the users suggestions to the core problem.
One of my biggest takeaways from the reading for this course was how end users can often identify the symptom instead of the problem when describing their troubles interacting with a computer. Or even worse they may suggest the solution to their problem but it isn't the best solution, just one they are familiar with. It is important for designers to be able to understand the difference between these two things. Finding the route cause of the problem can often result in the exploration of new ways to solve the problem that end users may never think to ask for.

- Test early. Test Often. 
One of the most useful tools in the process was the use of "Wizard of Oz" style testing. These tests allowed us to determine if users would have the desired response early in or development cycle. In our [Design for Tension](https://medium.com/@nxgamarra/design-for-tension-c81434e5096c) project doing these tests alerted us to sever avenues for improving our chat bot. If they did not we still had plenty of time to implement changes.

- There are no bad ideas until there are.
This is in a way borrowed from every other time I have had a course teach brainstorming to me. The idea being while in the early stages of brainstorming no ideas should get shot down in order to avoid accidentally shooting down a good idea or to prevent a team member from feeling that their contribution isn't being taken seriously.

- Weight the cons then the pros.
After brainstorming is wrapping up some of the ideas will need to get eliminated. I believe it is important to go through the cons and then the pros. The reason for this is that people often have a strong emotional attachment to their favorite idea from a brainstorming session. Considering the cons first allows the group to take a more objective approach to eliminating options. After considering the cons the pros of an idea can be useful to break ties between options with similar flaws. 

- Know when to quit.
When making a prototype it is important to know when it is good enough. Spending too much time on something that was only ever mean to be a proof on concept can result in wasted time and energy. It is important to stop directly working on and improving your product periodically and ask yourself if it fulfills your needs for demonstrating the desired functionality.

# HCI Portfolio 

Here is a portfolio of all of the Medium posts for the projects I worked on this term.  Additionally each link has a image below it of part of the project I most directly worked on. 

If I were to choose one of the projects as the best I would say it my teams [Design for Wellbeing](https://medium.com/@ilanazeldin/design-for-wellbeing-7cc8d2f7a9a7). The reason for this is that it was the most technically complicated project in terms of coding and it worked fairly well. To try out the projecte click [here](https://brcoll.github.io/DesignForWellbeing/). The purpose of this project was to encourage adoptions of pets and inform people about health benifits of pet wonership. This was made into a short emotional response quiz game where the users facial reaction to photos of cats or dogs would be used to determine if the person was a cat or dog person.
